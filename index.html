            <img src="akira.png" alt="Akira">
            <h3>Akira Toriyama(1955-2024)</h3>
            <p>Akira Toriyama was a Japanese manga artist and character designer. He first achieved mainstream
                recognition for creating the popular manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball (his
                most famous work) and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon
                Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Toriyama came to be regarded as one of the most important
                authors in the history of manga with his works highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball,
                which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.

            </p>
            <p>He earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen/shōjo manga with Dr. Slump, and it went on to
                sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime
                created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended.

            </p>
            <p>His next series, Dragon Ball, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world.
                Having sold 260 million copies worldwide, it is one of the best-selling manga series of all
                time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its
                highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more
                successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In
                2019, Toriyama was decorated a Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his
                contributions to the arts.</p>
